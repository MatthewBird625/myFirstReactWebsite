# referencing and sources

I have been careful to reference where I got my material from. I have included links to my REGEX sources for the login and registration above where they are delcared.

Apart from a date conversion(referenced in Profile.js), The only other material used/referenced is the RMIT-FWP WEEK 8 lab. I have included a note that this lab is also used in the related files.

It was primarily used as a starter base for the back end and getting up and running with the Posts and the User models.

# Server/express

To Setup the server-

cd into the express directory then run from terminal:

`npm install`

To Run:

`node server.js`

# React App front end

To Setup the React frontend:

cd into the React directory then run from terminal:

`npm install`

To Run:

`npm start`

# React App front end unit Testing

cd into the React directory then run from terminal:

`npm test`

In Regards to the testing here- my implementation is not the best.

I have working Tests for the registration form and the login form.

I however could not get around issues of test running endlessly due to the API calls in other files(I could not figure out in time how to mock this.)

As a result I have tests for the Profile Editing and the Post Page- however these tests are commented out. I have included them to show my attempt but they are commented out as they endlessly run
